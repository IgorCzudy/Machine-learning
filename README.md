# Machine-learning

Files description 
  * desision_tree_from_scratch.py - implementation of the decision tree algorithm from scratch, without any ready packages like scikit. (entropy calculation, conditional entropy calculation, information gain calculation, gain ratio calculation, simple drawing of a decision tree) I used well known Titanic dataset for testing performance.
  * k-means_from_scratch.ipynb - implementation of the k-means algorithm from scratch with random centroid initialization and 2 stopping conditions: max iterations and centroid convergence. I used cereal products with their dietary characteristics dataset for testing and visualizing an output with PCA algorithm. 
  * imageColorization.html - Autoencoder for image colorization project. 
  * hufmanCodes.py - Implementation of Huffman coding greedy algorithm. I used the priority queue and "__lt__" magic function in implementation to improve performance. 


The rest files are notebooks I have done on ML course.
